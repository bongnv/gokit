[go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) is a powerful framework to build microservices. However, it requires lots of boilerplate codes; hence it can introduce unnecessary complexibity in codebase.

This tool is created to generate those boilerplate codes, thus to avoid potential human mistake when writing them. Therefore, the tool also introduced an opinioned implementation of `go-kit`.
